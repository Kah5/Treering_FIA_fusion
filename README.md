# Treering_FIA_fusion
Repository for fusing tree ring and forest inventory data across the interior west US

Note: some of the main code that Mike developed is over on the PEcAn repository, specifically for running the state-space model code
This repository will contain some specific code to the regional fusion, biomass scaling, and other analyses
